Children always complain that their parents cannot understand them while parents feel sorry that their children seldom listen to them. Why?<br />\n  \tFirst of all, owing to different experiences, parents and children have different likes and dislikes. Children are energetic and curious, eager to embrace new things, while parents are more practical and stable, preferring a sober attitude towards new things. Besides, children want to have some privacy and independence, while parents want to take children under their wings all the time. When children turn a deaf ear to their well-intentioned advice, they feel frustrated and disappointed.\nTo solve this problem, parents should treat their children as friends and try to understand their feelings. Meanwhile, children should respect their parents and be aware of their parents' good intention The problem will be solved if parents and children both make their efforts.","questionattrs":null,"tags":" \u5199\u4f5c","words":null,"analysis":null}}},{"id":"1744","paper_id":"2","question_type":"0","description":"Directions: In this part, you will have 15 minutes to go over the passage quickly and answer the questions on Answer Sheet 1.For questions 1-7, choose the best answer from the four choices marked A) ,B),C) and D).For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.","title":"<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:24px;\">Plagiarism Lines Blur for Students in Digital Age</span> \n</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:16px;\">[1]Digital technology makes copying and pasting easy, of course.
