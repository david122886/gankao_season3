Children always complain that their parents cannot understand them while parents feel sorry that their children seldom listen to them. Why?<br />\n  \tFirst of all, owing to different experiences, parents and children have different likes and dislikes. Children are energetic and curious, eager to embrace new things, while parents are more practical and stable, preferring a sober attitude towards new things. Besides, children want to have some privacy and independence, while parents want to take children under their wings all the time. When children turn a deaf ear to their well-intentioned advice, they feel frustrated and disappointed.\nTo solve this problem, parents should treat their children as friends and try to understand their feelings. Meanwhile, children should respect their parents and be aware of their parents' good intention The problem will be solved if parents and children both make their efforts.","questionattrs":null,"tags":" \u5199\u4f5c","words":null,"analysis":null}}},{"id":"1744","paper_id":"2","question_type":"0","description":"Directions: In this part, you will have 15 minutes to go over the passage quickly and answer the questions on Answer Sheet 1.For questions 1-7, choose the best answer from the four choices marked A) ,B),C) and D).For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.","title":"<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:24px;\">Plagiarism Lines Blur for Students in Digital Age</span> \n</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:16px;\">[1]Digital technology makes copying and pasting easy, of course.

We must learn to recognize risks, because if we can\u2019t see the risks we\u2019re taking, we can\u2019t make responsible choices. To identify risks, we need to know the rules and be aware of the facts. For example, one who doesn\u2019t know the rules about plagiarism () may accidentally use words or ideas without giving proper credit, or one who fails to keep careful research notes may unintentionally fail to quote and cite sources as required. But the fact that such a violation is \u201cunintentional\u201d does not excuse the misconduct. Ignorance is not a defense.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\"><strong>\u201cBut Everybody Does It\u201d</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">Most people who get in trouble do know the rules and facts but manage to fool themselves about the risks they\u2019re taking by using excuses: \u201ceveryone else does it,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not hurting anyone,\u201d or \u201cI really need this grade.\u201d Excuses can get very elaborate: \u201cI know I\u2019m looking at another's exam but that\u2019s not cheating because I\u2019m just checking my answers, not copying.\u201d We must be honest about our actions and avoid excuses. &nbsp;If we fool ourselves into believing we\u2019re not doing anything wrong, we can\u2019t see the real choice we\u2019re making \u2013 and that leads to bad decisions.</span> \n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-family:''Times New Roman'';font-size:small;\"><span style=\"line-height:24px;\"><br />\n</span></span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">To avoid fooling yourself, watch out for excuses and try this test: Ask how you would feel if your actions were public and anyone could be watching over your shoulder. If you\u2019d rather hide your actions, that\u2019s an indication that you\u2019re taking a risk and rationalizing it to yourself.</span> \n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\"><strong>Evaluating Risks</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">To decide whether a risk is worth taking, you must examine the consequences, in the future as well as right now, negative as well as positive, and to others as well as to yourself. Those who take risks they later regret usually focus on immediate benefits, and simply haven\u2019t considered what might go wrong. The consequences of getting caught are serious and may include a \u201c0\u201d on a test or assignment, an \u201cF\u201d in the class, suspension (\u6682\u4ee4\u505c\u5b66) or dismissal from school and a ruined reputation. In fact when you break a rule or law, you lose control over your life and give others the power to impose punishment that you have no control over. This is an extremely vulnerable (\u8106\u5f31\u7684) position. There may be some matters of life and death or highest principle, which might justify such a risk, but there aren\u2019t many things that fall in this category.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\"><strong>Getting Away With It \u2013 Or Not</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">Those who don\u2019t get caught pay an even higher price. A cheater doesn\u2019t learn from the test, which deprives (\u5265\u593a) him/her of an education. Cheating undermines confidence and independence: the cheater is a fraud, and knows that without dishonesty, he/she would have failed. Cheating destroys self-respect and integrity, leaving the cheater ashamed, guilty, and afraid of getting caught. Worst of all, a cheater who doesn\u2019t get caught the first time usually cheats again, not only because he/she is farther behind, but also because it seems \u201ceasier.\u201d This slippery slope of eroding ethics and bigger risks leads only to disaster. Eventually, the cheater gets caught, and the later he/she gets caught, the worse the consequences.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\"><strong>Cheating Hurts Others, Too</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">Cheaters often feel invisible, as if their actions \u201cdon\u2019t count\u201d and don\u2019t really hurt anyone. But individual choices have an intense cumulative (\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684) effect. Cheating can spread like a disease. Recent statistics suggest 30% or more of college students cheat. If a class is graded on a curve, cheating hurts others\u2019 grades. Even if there is no curve, cheating \u201cpoisons\u201d the classroom, and others may feel pressured to join in. (\u201cIf I don\u2019t cheat, I can\u2019t compete with those who do.\u201d) Cheating also has a destructive impact on teachers. The real reward of good teaching is seeing students learn, but a cheater says, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in what you\u2019re trying to teach; all I care about is stealing a grade, regardless of the effect on others.\u201d The end result is a destructive attack on the quality of your education. &nbsp;Finally cheating can hurt the reputation of the university and harm those who worked hard for their degree.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\"><strong>Why Integrity Matters</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">If cheating becomes the norm, then we are in big trouble. We must rely on the honesty and good faith of others. If not, we couldn\u2019t put money in the bank, buy food, clothing, or medicine from others, drive across a bridge, get on a plane, go to the dentist - the list is endless. There are many examples of the vast harm that is caused when individuals forget or ignore the effect their dishonesty can have. The savings and loan scandal, the stock market and junk bond swindles, and, of course, Watergate, have undermined the faith of many Americans in the integrity of political and economic leaders and society as a whole. Such incidents take a tremendous toll on our nation's economy and our individual well-being. For example, but for the savings and loan debacle, there might be funds available to reduce the national debt and pay for education.</span> \n</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-family:''Times New Roman'';font-size:small;\"><span style=\"line-height:24px;\"><br />\n</span></span><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;color:#333333;\">In sum, we all have a common stake in our school, our community, and our society.
